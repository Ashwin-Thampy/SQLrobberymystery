committed by a woman who went to SQL Theatre in March but not once
in February. So we get the details of all women from table driver_
license and person and facebook_event_checkin. Then we get a list
of all the women who went to SQL Theatre between February 1,2018 and 
March 31, 2018. We eliminate all the women who went to SQL Theatre in
February as well as in March and we get the result of a woman named
Caroline Navia.*/

/* Hence we can conclude that Caroline Navia committed the crime since she went to SQL Theatre in March but not once in February.*/
